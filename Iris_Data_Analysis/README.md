# Iris Flower Classification & Pattern Recognition

## Project Overview
Analyzed the classic Iris dataset to classify flower species based on Sepal and Petal dimensions. This project introduced scientific data visualization techniques.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Visualization: Scatter Plots and Pair Plots.

## Key Insights
- Iris-Setosa: Easily distinguishable from others due to its small Petal size (forms a separate cluster).
- Versicolor vs. Virginica: These two species have overlapping Sepal dimensions but can be separated using Petal dimensions.
- Conclusion: Petal Length and Width are the most critical features for classification.

## What I Learned
- Using Seaborn for advanced plotting (scatterplot).
- Understanding multivariate analysis using the hue parameter.
- Interpreting clusters and patterns in scientific data.
