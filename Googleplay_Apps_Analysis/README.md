# Google Play Store Apps Analysis

## Project Overview
Performed a comprehensive analysis of the Play Store market. The main challenge was cleaning "dirty" data (removing symbols like '$', '+', ',') to perform numerical analysis on Price and Installs.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Advanced Cleaning: String manipulation and Regex handling.

## Key Insights
- Most Installed: 'Game' and 'Communication' categories dominate the market.
- Pricing: Identified 'I Am Rich' as an outlier (most expensive app at ~$400).
- Rating Distribution: Most apps have a high rating (between 4.0 and 5.0), showing a left-skewed distribution.

## What I Learned
- Converting Object types to Numeric.
- Using string replacement methods to handle special characters.
- Visualizing distributions using Histograms and Barplots.
