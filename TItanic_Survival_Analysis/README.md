# Titanic Survival Prediction (EDA)

## Project Overview
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to determine factors that influenced passenger survival rates.

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Numpy)
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values in Age and Cabin columns.

## Key Insights
- Gender Factor: Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males.
- Class Factor: 1st Class passengers had better survival chances compared to 3rd Class.
- Missing Data: Successfully imputed missing 'Age' values using the median strategy.

## What I Learned
- Identifying and handling Null values.
- Using logical operators to filter survivors.
- Calculating percentages and averages from raw data.
